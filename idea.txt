 I have an idea for a project that helps students solve questions and assignments.

 It consists of two dashboards: The first one is for the student who logs in and subscribes to the application.
  The subscription gives you the ability to upload assignments, and there are teachers available to solve them.
   It also allows you to view solutions to previous questions.


The second dashboard is for the teacher, showing all the unsolved questions. 
The teacher can reserve a question and is given a time, like 60 minutes, to solve it during this time
, and a notification of the solution is sent to the student.

Secondly: A search engine that searches for solved questions within the site.

Thirdly: The same as the second point, but instead of uploading a picture, it involves uploading a PDF file, and the most important thing is the payment methods, like a coupon.
